## Models

Q1. What models are probabilistic?
Q2. What models are rule-based?


### Decision Trees

Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that uses a set of rules to make decisions, similarly to how humans make decisions.

- Decision trees can perform both classification and regression tasks

Q3. When do we use classification and regression tasks? Hint - what type of prediction?
