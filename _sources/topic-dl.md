## Neural Network

### Playground

Use the playground - http://playground.tensorflow.org/ (Links to an external site.) 

- change activation, learning rate, regularization, # epochs
- change problem types (classification versus regression)
- change # of hidden layers
- change datasets
- examine loss

Question 1. Are you able to improve your training (loss is smaller)? What parameters can help you improve/optimize your training?

Question 2. What have you learned from this playground?
